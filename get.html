            <h3>Volunteer Testimonies</h3>
            <p>"We did a drawing tutorial from my 'how to draw' guides. As a class they went through step by step how to draw an elephant. Using some basic drawing techniques with shape, perspective and mark making. The students then decorated and added to their drawings to create a scene. </p>
            <p>​The experience was a lot of fun, the staff and the students were really welcoming and the students did a great job. The kids there are so friendly and fun, I enjoyed the class as much as they did. I'm looking forward to going back and spending more time with the special people."</p>

            <p>"My name’s Shanti and I’m a volunteer with Da Nang Go. Being a part of this organization has provided me with incredible experiences assisting those in need in this community. Da Nang Go organized a relief trip into the jungle of Tay Giang Province East of Da Nang. I was able to travel with them to this place which had been adversely affected by flooding and landslides due to the excess amount of storms this year.</p>
            <p>​We handed out care packages to school-children and families in remote villages. You could tell how excited they were to see what they had received and how grateful they were to know that someone cared about them. We were able to laugh, hug, and play despite their difficult circumstances. I was extremely moved and I left that place with my heart full of gratitude and humility.</p>
            <p>Danang Go has also organized the extraordinary opportunity for me to volunteer every week at the VAVA centers in Da Nang. These are centers for children and adults affected by the toxic chemical Agent Orange or Dioxin used in the Vietnam/US war. The individuals that are at these centers have a range of disabilities. Some physical, some mental, or emotional. After learning about Agent Orange in the museums of Hanoi and Saigon, I wanted to know how I could help but was not even sure where to find more information. Da Nang Go reached out saying they needed volunteers and thought I would be a good fit---THEY WERE RIGHT! </p>
            <p>​I don’t know how to explain how much joy comes from volunteering with these beautiful people. They are so loving, sweet, and funny; we always have an incredible time together. We’ve done art projects, made Christmas cards, decorated cookies, sang songs, played guitar, and danced together. Da Nang Go makes it an awesome volunteer experience by organizing all the details and keeping you very informed of the schedule, events, and other important details. I highly recommend being a volunteer with Da Nang Go because it has been an amazing experience. I look forward to working with them on many more projects, events, and opportunities to improve the community in which we live."</p>
            <h5>Shantelle Halie</h5>
            <p>“When Sarah asked me if I would be interested to volunteer with DaNang Go for VAVA, I felt blessed. I somehow find places or places find me where I can make endless arts with pure innocence and  life giving energy. In projects where we get chance to interact with survivors of tradegy, it kind of tells you that life is mysterious and magical at the same time, and no matter how bad the world is but if we look inside there is always some love to share.</p>
            <p>Working with children brings me great joy. I love their creativity, kids can think so uniquely and simple that it teaches me a new think in class, everytime. Process of colouring where we get lost in it and are busy in finding the colour we want to put in picture next, looking for it all over the desk is my favourite part. It tells me how much joy colours can bring and what importance it holds in our lives. When kids put their final touches to arts, the smile they give is more than Gold... It is so precious smile of creation, smile of self believe, smile of relief, smile of that everything is good, melts my heart. These smiles keep calling me back with lots colours.</p>
            <p>VAVA kids are truly special and so joyful. I wish them the best and wonderful life.”</p>
