                <h3>What we do</h3>
                <p> 	
                    Da Nang Go has created multiple projects to help those in need in Central Vietnam.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    We aim to provide relief to those in need by reasons of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantages
