            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> 	
                The team originally came together to provide emergency relief to people in Central Vietnam who had been adversely affected by flooding following a series of severe storms in October 2020. The group organised a fundraising event which raised over 150,000,000VND (around $6500USD) towards the cause. Read more about our flood relief trips <a href="#">here</a>
            </p>
            <p> 
                Da Nang Go was established shortly after with the mission to provide aid to those in need on a long term basis. We partner with other NGOs, orphanages and schools to create a streamlined process of recruiting and connecting volunteers to our partners. Da Nang Go also organises fundraising events to support our Volunteer Program as well as our partners.

                <h4>Isis Mok</h4>
                <h4>Executive Director</h4>
                <p>
                    Isis' love of travel and culture brought her to Da Nang in 2015, where she made a career in hospitality and events management, as well as a regular hobby of volunteering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more work she did with local charities, the more she saw a need for organizing volunteers. In time her helping hobby evolved, until she was planning everything from fund-raisers to supply runs for flood victims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Da Nang Go, Isis seeks to combine her passion for helping others with her professional experience, in the hope of putting like-minded helpers into the places where their help is most needed.

                <h4>Director of External Relations</h4>
                <p>
                    On finishing her degree in Nottingham, UK, Jennifer returned to her hometown in Greater Manchester where she entered the Recruitment Industry. This fast-paced environment gave her a strong foundation in networking and connecting people. Having always dreamed of living abroad, she planned to take her skills across the globe to Australia. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jennifer stumbled across Vietnam in 2013 and became enthralled by its beauty and culture, leading to a complete change of plans. She developed a strong interest in motorbike trekking which has taken her all over the country. Having experienced the kindness and hospitality of the Vietnamese people she felt a strong desire to give back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Da Nang Go Jennifer aims to combine her experience and skillset to facilitate collaboration with other charitable organisations and make a difference for people in Central Vietnam.

                <p>
                    ​From a young age, Sarah's passion for outreach initiatives fueled her ambition to take action in her community. This led her to work with inner city youth in her home city of Chicago, where she organized summer programs and field trips for a youth center, and started her work in tutoring children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ​In 2015 Sarah pursued her love of travel and working with children, by leaving the US to teach in Asia. After a year of teaching in South Korea, Sarah arrived in Vietnam to teach in a local English center. She instantly fell in love with the city of Da Nang and has volunteered in various charitable efforts over the last several years. Sarah's drive to create successful outreach programs in the community continues with her work in Da Nang Go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ​As Director of Internal Communications, Sarah is committed to helping volunteers find their place in the charity, and facilitate their goals to take part in Da Nang Go's events and projects.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up in a small town afforded her the opportunity to get involved in projects ranging from activity planning at a nursing home to literacy programs at the local elementary school. She carried this passion after leaving the US in 2011 and beginning her adventures abroad. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    ​After settling in Da Nang in 2019, she saw a need and wanted to give back to the community she now calls home. Da Nang Go allows her to do just this, and she is excited to watch it continue to grow.
